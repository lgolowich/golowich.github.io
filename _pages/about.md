I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley, advised by [Venkatesan Guruswami](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~venkatg/). I am interested in problems relating to quantum computation, error correction and complexity theory, expander graphs and high-dimensional expanders, and more.

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Harvard Univesity, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu).
