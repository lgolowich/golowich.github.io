I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Venkatesan Guruswami](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~venkatg/). My research interests include quantum computation, error correction, complexity theory, expander graphs/high-dimensional expanders, and more.

Previously, as an undergraduate at Harvard Univesity, I was lucky to be advised by [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu).
